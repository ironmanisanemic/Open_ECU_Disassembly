Up until now, i have just been comparing code segements between A9L and whatever bin i am looking at. A9L is being used as the gold master to reference currently. Most early bins seem to line up with A9L fairly well. Later bins like T4M0 resemble later EEC-V code from what little i have looked. As far as i know, there are no other listings as complete as the A9L that are public. So looking at the later EEC-IV bins will be much more manual work.
